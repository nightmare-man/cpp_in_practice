# cpp_in_practice
### What is this?
  These code record my improvement in cpp.All them originate from <<C++ programming:princle and practice>>,a great book to help you using c++ rather than just geting lost in c++'s detail.
### How to run these code?
  
  ①Before chapter14,you can run one project by clicking "projectX.sIn".
  
  
  ②GUI learing begins since chapter14,so we need install fltk(you can get it at https://fltk.org).Follow these step:
    
    
    1.download and uncompress fltk source file.
    
    
    2.use cmake to get a sIn solution in "build" dir(need make by yourself).
    
    
    3.Generate solution by visual studio.
    
    
    4.copy "abi-version.h" to "FL" dir (there are two FL dir,one generate by cmake,another in source file,there means the later).
    
    
    5.set your project to include fltk.ALL ".lib" files included.All ".lib" files in "build/lib",and ".h" files in "FL".(for lib,you need set lib path and additional dependencies)
### My work
  reproduce example code, finish part practice I think important or interesting.At chapter14,clear mess code in gui interface given by author(too old and too mess,can't work dirctly)
